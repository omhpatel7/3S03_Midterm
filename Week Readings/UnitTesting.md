# [Summary on Unit Testing](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html)

- It is hard to define **unit** due to it's range of definitions as a class, function, or group of classes. 
- **Solitary** means isolating units with test doubles/mocks.
- **Sociable** means testing units with real collaborators.
- **Speed** is critical because fast tests allow developers to run them frequently, catching bugs early. We need to balance thoroughness with speed to maintain productivity.
- Thereâ€™s no **right** approach when it comes to testing. Teams should adapt definitions of units, testing styles, and speed thresholds to their needs. 
- During testing, we need to consider feedback and code reliability. 
- Unit testing should be used as a tool for confidence and quality.
