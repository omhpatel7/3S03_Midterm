## Section 6: The economics and business model of SW testing

- The customers do not care about the code quality, they care about the product and whether it meets the requirements.

## Section 7: So why should I care about testing?

- As a software engineer, we need testing, as, we should not deploy code without testing if it causes errors or it does not meet criterias. 

- In real-life scenarios, we might have to work with QA teams, or if working in small comapny, we might be tasked to do QA's work.
