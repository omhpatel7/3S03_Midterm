# Week 3 - Lecture 3

## Section 3: You can classify testing techniques

- Exploratory testing **[black-box]** **[functional testing]** 
- Specification-based testing **[black-box]** **[functional testing]** 
- Model-based testing **[black-box]** **[functional testing]** 
- Fuzz testing **[black-box]** **[non-functional testing]** 
- Partition testing **[black-box]** **[functional testing]** 
- Boundary testing **[black-box]** **[functional testing]** 
- Coverage-based testing **[white-box]** **[functional testing]** 
- Fault injection **[grey-box]** **[non-functional testing]** 

All of the techniques above are dynamic testing techniques because they require executing the software to evaluate its behavior.

## Section 4: You can fit testing into any software lifecycle

- Waterfall Model:

    - Requirements -> Design -> Implementation -> Verification -> Maintenance

- How is testing typically performed?

    - Unit Testing -> Integration Testing -> System Testing -> Acceptance Testing

- Typical testing process and its artifacts include:

    - Requirement Analysis
    - Test Planning
    - Test Development
    - Test Execution
    - Test Reporting
    - Test Result Analysis
